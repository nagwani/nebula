# Drupal Canvas Code Components rules and best practices

# Project structure

This project uses a two-folder structure to separate example code from working
code:

```
src/
├── components/     # Your working components (Storybook reads from here)
│   └── global.css  # Base styles imported by Storybook
├── stories/        # Your working stories (Storybook reads from here)
└── lib/            # Library utilities and mocks

examples/
├── components/     # Example component implementations (for reference)
└── stories/        # Example stories (for reference)
```

# Package manager

Detect the package manager by checking for lock files in the project root:

- `package-lock.json` → npm (`npm run`, `npx`)
- `yarn.lock` → yarn (`yarn`, `yarn dlx`)
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` → pnpm (`pnpm`, `pnpm dlx`)
- `bun.lockb` → bun (`bun run`, `bunx`)

Use the detected package manager for all commands in these instructions.

# Creating new components

**Always start from an example.** When asked to create a new component:

1. Browse `examples/components/` to find a similar component that can serve as a
   starting point (e.g., use `blockquote` as a base for an "alert" component, or
   `button` for any interactive element)
2. Copy the example component folder to `src/components/<new_name>/`
3. Copy the corresponding story from `examples/stories/` to `src/stories/`
4. Modify the copied files to implement the new component

This approach ensures consistent patterns for `component.yml` structure, JSX
conventions, and Storybook story format across all components.

**Example:** To create a new "Alert" component based on the Blockquote example:

```bash
cp -r examples/components/blockquote src/components/alert
cp examples/stories/blockquote.stories.jsx src/stories/alert.stories.jsx
```

Then modify the copied files to implement the Alert component.

Components use the `@/components` import alias, which points to
`src/components`. When you copy and modify examples, the imports will work
automatically.

# Validating changes

After creating or modifying components, always validate your code by running the
`code:fix` script:

```bash
code:fix
```

This command runs Prettier and ESLint with auto-fix enabled, ensuring consistent
formatting, common issues, and Drupal Canvas Code Component requirements. Run
this before considering any component work complete.

If the command reports errors that couldn't be automatically fixed, address them
manually in the code and re-run the command until it passes without errors.

# Uploading components

When component work is complete and validated, ask the user if they would like
to upload the modified components to Canvas. Use the following command format:

```bash
canvas upload -c component1,component2,component3
```

Replace `component1,component2,component3` with the actual component names that
were created or modified (e.g., `canvas upload -c button,card,hero`).

# Component metadata files (`component.yml`)

Each component requires a `component.yml` file that defines its metadata, props,
and slots.

## File structure

Every `component.yml` must include these top-level keys:

```yaml
name: Component Name # Human-readable display name
machineName: component_name # Machine name in snake_case
status: true # Whether the component is enabled
required: [] # Array of required prop names
props:
  properties:
    # ... prop definitions
slots: [] # Array of slot definitions or empty
```

**Props must have title and examples.**

Every prop definition must include a `title` for the UI label. The `examples`
array is required for required props and recommended for all others. Only the
first example value is used by Drupal Canvas.

```yaml
props:
  properties:
    heading:
      title: Heading
      type: string
      examples:
        - Enter a heading...
```

## Prop types

### Text

Basic text input. Stored as a string value.

```yaml
type: string
examples:
  - Hello, world!
```

### Formatted text

Rich text content with HTML formatting support, displayed in a block context.

```yaml
type: string
contentMediaType: text/html
x-formatting-context: block
examples:
  - <p>This is <strong>formatted</strong> text with HTML.</p>
```

### Link

URL or URI reference for links to internal or external resources.

```yaml
type: string
format: uri-reference
examples:
  - https://example.com
```

**Note:** The format can be either `uri` (accepts only absolute URLs) or
`uri-reference` (accepts both absolute and relative URLs).

### Image

Reference to an image object with metadata like alt text, dimensions, and file
URL. Only the file URL is required to exist, all other metadata is always
optional.

```yaml
type: object
$ref: json-schema-definitions://canvas.module/image
examples:
  - src: >-
      https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1484959014842-cd1d967a39cf?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1770&q=80
    alt: Woman playing the violin
    width: 1770
    height: 1180
```

### Video

Reference to a video object with metadata like dimensions and file URL. Only the
file URL is required to exist, all other metadata is always optional.

```yaml
type: object
$ref: json-schema-definitions://canvas.module/video
examples:
  - src: https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1340051874/video/aerial-top-down-view-of-a-container-cargo-ship.mp4?s=mp4-640x640-is&k=20&c=5qPpYI7TOJiOYzKq9V2myBvUno6Fq2XM3ITPGFE8Cd8=
    poster: https://example.com/600x400.png
```

### Boolean

True or false value.

```yaml
type: boolean
examples:
  - false
```

### Integer

Whole number value without decimal places.

```yaml
type: integer
examples:
  - 42
```

### Number

Numeric value that can include decimal places.

```yaml
type: number
examples:
  - 3.14
```

### List: text

A predefined list of text options that the user can select from.

```yaml
type: string
enum:
  - option1
  - option2
  - option3
meta:enum:
  option1: Option 1
  option2: Option 2
  option3: Option 3
examples:
  - option1
```

### List: integer

A predefined list of integer options that the user can select from.

```yaml
type: integer
enum:
  - 1
  - 2
  - 3
meta:enum:
  1: Option 1
  2: Option 2
  3: Option 3
examples:
  - 1
```

## Enum value naming

Enum values must use lowercase, machine-friendly identifiers. Use `meta:enum` to
provide human-readable display labels for the UI.

**Note:** Enum values cannot contain dots.

```yaml
# Correct
enum:
  - left_aligned
  - center_aligned
meta:enum:
  left_aligned: Left aligned
  center_aligned: Center aligned
examples:
  - left_aligned

# Wrong - using display labels as enum values
enum:
  - Left aligned
  - Center aligned
```

The `examples` value must be the enum value, not the display label.

### Enum values must match JSX component variants

When using class-variance-authority (CVA) or similar libraries in the JSX
component, the variant keys must exactly match the enum values defined in
`component.yml`.

```jsx
// component.yml defines: enum: [left_aligned, center_aligned]
// CVA variants must match:
const variants = cva("base-classes", {
  variants: {
    layout: {
      left_aligned: "text-left", // matches enum value
      center_aligned: "text-center", // matches enum value
    },
  },
});
```

## Slots

Slots allow other components to be embedded within a component. In React, slots
are received as props containing the rendered children.

```yaml
slots:
  content:
    title: Content
  buttons:
    title: Buttons
```

In the JSX component, slots are destructured as props and rendered directly:

```jsx
const Section = ({ width, content }) => {
  return <div className={sectionVariants({ width })}>{content}</div>;
};
```

Use an empty array when the component has no slots:

```yaml
slots: []
```
