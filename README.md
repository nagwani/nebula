# Nebula

Nebula provides a template repository for
[`@drupal-canvas/create`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@drupal-canvas/create)
to scaffold a new codebase for working with
[Drupal Canvas Code Components](https://project.pages.drupalcode.org/canvas/code-components).
The codebase serves as a development environment fully set up with tooling and
examples for AI-assisted development workflows.

## Getting started

Instead of cloning this repository, create a new project interactively:

```
npx @drupal-canvas/create@latest
```

## AI-assisted development workflows

Different AI tools have different configuration files. To apply the provided AI
instructions to your AI agent use:

```
npx ruler apply --agents=<agent1,agent2,...>
```

For example, `npx ruler apply --agents=cursor` or
`npx ruler apply --agents=claude`.  
For complete list of supported agents, see:
<https://github.com/intellectronica/ruler#supported-ai-agents>.
